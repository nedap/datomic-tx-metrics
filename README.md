# datomic-tx-metrics
Collecting Datomic Transactor + JVM metrics for consumption by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) by offering a web endpoint.

```clojure
[com.nedap.staffing-solutions/datomic-tx-metrics "0.4.0-alpha12"]
```


## How does it work?

### Registering the metrics collector at the transactor.
Add the following line to your `transactor.properties` file:

```
metrics-callback=datomic-tx-metrics.core/tx-metrics-callback-handler
```

Next ensure that the JAR (you can download one in the release section) is present within Datomic's `/lib` directory to be loaded at runtime. An example leveraging a Docker container can be found in the examples section of this repository.

### Configuring the metrics collector

* specifiy the port of the web server fired up by the metrics collector using the environment variable `METRICS_PORT` when starting the transactor (defaults to _11509_) 

### Scraping Metrics

* Metrics collector fires up a web server when loaded by the transactor
* Metrics are typically sent from the transactor to the callback function every `10s` (keep this in mind since values might not change over this duration).
* Scrape the collected metrics by requesting the started metrics web server under the `/metrics` endpoint

The following is an exemplary Prometheus configuration file for scraping the metrics endpoint:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  scrape_timeout: 10s
  evaluation_interval: 15s
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets: []
    scheme: http
    timeout: 10s
    api_version: v1
scrape_configs:
- job_name: prometheus
  honor_timestamps: true
  scrape_interval: 15s
  scrape_timeout: 10s
  metrics_path: /metrics
  scheme: http
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - localhost:9090
- job_name: datomic-tx-metrics
  scrape_interval: 10s
  scrape_timeout: 5s
  metrics_path: /metrics
  scheme: http
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - localhost:11509
```
_**Note:** adjust the target according to your own deployment state._

## Troubleshooting

__Problem:__ The transactor refuses to start because there is an error related to netty (some methods cannot be found).

__Solution:__ Depending on the Datomic version in use the netty version that comes with it may be too old missing methods required by this project. Resolve this issue by replacing the netty-all*.jar in Datomic's `/lib` directory with a newer one. _This is also covered by the docker example in the __examples__ section of the repository._
